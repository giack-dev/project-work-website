  <title>Terremoti in Turchia/Siria</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Turkey, starting from 07/02 has suffered several earthquakes ranging between 4.1 and 7.8 in magnitude, (mostly in the city of Kahramanmara≈ü, the epicenter of the earthquake)
    in the last 20 years the state has encountered a long series of more or less catastrophic earthquakes.
   Turkey has experienced many earthquakes over the years due to its geological position, the territory is located above 3 seismic plates:
   <ul>
    <li>North Anatolian Plate.</li>
    <li>North African plate.</li>
    <li>Arabica plate.</li>
   </ul>
   The earthquakes have caused a frightening balance, the number of victims has reached almost 40,000 and the OMS says that this number could double, however the number of victims is only hypothetical because the areas controlled by the rebels, both in Turkey and in Syria, they do not "release" information either on the death balance or  the living conditions that people have to tolerate.
